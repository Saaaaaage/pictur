    TODO:  Implement sort order for images attached to posts

    Posts need a sort order and there are a number of ways to do this:
      1 - Patch active storage to hold sort order
      2 - Create a join table to sit between the posts and the active storage table
            post_uploads could then store sort_order and description
      DONT DO ARRAYS
  
    I understand #2 very well, but do not understand the implications of #1 and #3.
